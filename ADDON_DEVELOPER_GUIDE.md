# MinCore Add-On Developer Guide (Archived)

MinCore no longer documents or supports external add-ons. All first-party
functionality ships inside the core modules contained in this repository, and
future work should focus on maintaining or extending those built-in modules.

For contributor guidance, refer to the [Developer Guide](README.md#developer-guide)
and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
